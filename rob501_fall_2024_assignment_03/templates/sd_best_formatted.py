def stereo_disparity_best(Il, Ir, bbox, maxd):
    """
    Best stereo correspondence algorithm.

    This function computes a stereo disparity image from left stereo 
    image Il and right stereo image Ir. Only disparity values within
    the bounding box region (inclusive) are evaluated.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    Il    - Left stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    Ir    - Right stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    bbox  - 2x2 np.array, bounding box, relative to left image, from top left
            corner to bottom right corner (inclusive). (x, y) in columns.
    maxd  - Integer, maximum disparity value; disparities must be within zero
            to maxd inclusive (i.e., don't search beyond maxd).
    
    Returns:
    --------
    Id  - Disparity image (map) as np.array, same size as Il.

    Idea: aggregate matching cost from multiple directions and minimize the cost to find the disparity map. This consists of the following key steps:
    1. Create a "cost volume" by splitting each pixel in the right image into a 3D entry, where the third dimension is each disparity level
    2. Compute matching costs: for each disparity level in the range [0, maxd], compute the matching cost for each pixel in the right image, store
       in the cost volume
       - can do this by "rolling" the right image by some disparity, and computing absolute differences 
    3. Aggregate costs: for each pixel in the cost volume, compute the aggregate cost by summing the matching costs from multiple directions:
        - i.e. loop through a number of directions (up, down, left, right, diagonals) and sum the matching costs.
        - This step enforces a smoothness constraint on the disparity map. It is also recommended to include a small penalty, P1, for small disparity
          changes and a larger penalty, P2, for larger disparity changes
        - the aggregate cost can be computed in a number of directions, commonly:
            - 4 (up, down, left, right)
            - 8 (4 + diagonals)
    4. For each pixel, select disparity with lowest aggregated cost: which represents the best match in the left image
    5. Return the disparity map (Id) using these disparities

    This method is more computationally expensive than local methods, but less expensive than some of the global methods discussed in the Scharstein paper

    # Hints:
    #
    #  - Loop over each image row, computing the local similarity measure, then
    #    aggregate. At the border, you may replicate edge pixels, or just avoid
    #    using values outside of the image.
    #
    #  - You may hard-code any parameters you require in this function.
    #
    #  - Use whatever window size you think might be suitable.
    #
    #  - Optimize for runtime AND for clarity.

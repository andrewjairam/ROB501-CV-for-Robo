Observations:
for gain <= 1: get "clean" control: points move smoothly to desired positions
after gain <= 1, i.e. starting from 1.25, camera starts to jitter quickly
    for lower gains the camera converges, just overshoots the initial positions, taking longer to converge
    for higher gains, the camera just rapidly jitters, never converging. on every frame, looks like the camera is at a random position
